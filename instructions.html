        <ul class="rules">
            <li>
                Wordle is simple.
            </li>
            <li>
                Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are and aren't in the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                Type in one letter in each box and click on the Check button to verify if you have guessed the word correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you guess a word, the letter tile will change colour to green,
                orange or grey, which all mean different things.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the letter is highlighted as green, that means the letter is in the correct place.
            </li>
            <li>
                If any of the letters is highlighted as orange, that means the letter in the wrong place.
            </li>
            <li>
                A grey tile means the letter isn't in the word at all. So you might want to exclude this letter in your next attempt.
            </li>
        </ul>
