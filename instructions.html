            Wordle is simple.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            When you guess a word, the letter tile will change colour to green, 
            yellow or grey,which all mean different things.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Green: The letter is right and in the correct position in the word. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
            If any of the letters is highlighted as yellow, 
            that means that that letter is in the word, but it's in the wrong place.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            A grey tile means the letter isn't in the word at all.
        </li>
    </ul>
