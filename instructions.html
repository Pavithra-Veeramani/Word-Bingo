            <li>
                Wordle is simple.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                When you guess a word, the letter tile will change colour to green,
                orange or grey,which all mean different things.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                If the letter is highlighted as green, that means the letter is in the correct place.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                If any of the letters is highlighted as orange,
                that means the letter in the wrong place.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                A grey tile means the letter isn't in the word at all.
            </li>
        </ul>
